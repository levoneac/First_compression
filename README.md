# First_compression
My first time trying to create a text compressor :D
This was a little project i did during the christmas holidays of 2023, after watching [computerphiles videos on huffman encoding and lz77](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umTbivyJoiI)

Its very slow(partly thanks to it being in python) and the solutions are probably very bad, but i wanted to do it without any help other than the videos. The files also need to be quite big for it to be of any use (around 1MB).

A textfile of 1141KB got compressed into 751KB - A 34% decrease. The caveat is that it took 10 minutes :D

## How to use it:
  ### Encoding:
    `python First_compressor.py -e file.txt -w file_to_write_result_to.txt`

  ### Decoding:
    `python First_compressor.py -d encoded_file.txt -w file_to_write_result_to.txt`

  If `-w` isnt given, it will print the result to the terminal.
  You can also supply the input for -e/--encode and -d/--decode with a string enclodes in quotes.
